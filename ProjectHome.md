Twinkle is a an update framework for the Java platform inspired by the Sparkle framework's philosophy: adding update support to your application shouldn't take more than one line of code (possibly none!).

The Twinkle update process is based on AppCast feeds. Creating feeds for your application is easy and can be easily integrated in your Ant/Maven environment.

Twinkle also supports integrity and authenticity check of downloaded update files based on MD5 hashes and/or DSA signed archives.

The framework's architecture aims to be modular and comfortably extensible to anyone needs.

**NOTE:**Twinkle is currently still in development but the source code is already available and the project is open for contributions.
